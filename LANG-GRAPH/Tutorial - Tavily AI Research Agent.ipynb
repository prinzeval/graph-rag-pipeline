Agentic RAG: Adds dynamic decision-making by enabling the LLM to decide whether additional steps, like using external tools or fetching more data, are needed before generating a response. LangGraph is a Python library designed to build stateful, multi-step applications that integrate LLMs with external tools. In this project, we’ll use LangGraph to implement our Agentic RAG workflow. LangChain imports: ChatOpenAI, UnstructuredURLLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, etc., are used to load documents, split text into chunks, and integrate vector-based retrieval with LLMs. LangGraph imports: StateGraph, ToolNode, and MemorySaver enable us to define and execute the workflow. workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model) workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\") workflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model) workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\")  # Cycle between tools and agent  ',\n",
