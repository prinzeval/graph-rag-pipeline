Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest\\nin the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we\\npresent a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order\\nplanning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We\\nshow that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread\\nintuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For\\ninstance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon\\nthe search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the\\nunderlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.', 'authors': ['S. Minton', 'J. Bresina', 'M.
