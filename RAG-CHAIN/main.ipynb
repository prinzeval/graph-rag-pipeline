The number of aid trucks entering the enclave will increase to 600 per day.\\n\\nThe deal was expected to allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes across Gaza, including in the devastated north. However, on Saturday the Israeli military issued a statement saying that people were not allowed to return north due to an ongoing dispute over a hostage who was not released Saturday.\\n\\nDuring the first 42-day phase, Israel is due to withdraw from Gaza’s population centers.

Among them was 28-year-old Ira, an American who said he has lived in Israel for eight years.\\n\\n“As you can see, everybody here is extremely excited to have them back in Israeli territory,” Ira – who is originally from Montana – told CNN after the van carrying the former hostages drove away. “They’ve been struggling for a long time.”\\n\\nThe American added that he hopes that US President Donald Trump can “get the rest of the hostages back as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“We really hope he can do a better, maybe even a better job than Biden did in his presidency,” he said.\\n\\nRonit, a 62-year-old Israeli, had also gathered at the helipad with her family to “celebrate the arrival of the hostages.”\\n\\nRonit, who only gave her first name, said she felt “very angry and very frustrated” at the show of force displayed by Hamas as they returned the four women.\\n\\nShe said that she thought Hamas’ display was exaggerated, and that the group has been weakened by Israel.\\n\\nPeople watch as a helicopter lands at Belinson hospital on Saturday.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nCelebrations erupt in West Bank city following Palestinian prisoner release\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Billy Stockwell\\n\\nPalestinian prisoners are greeted by a crowd after being released in Ramallah, West Bank on Saturday.\\n\\nEmotional scenes played out in the streets of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, following the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention facilities.\\n\\nPrisoners wearing grey tracksuits and blue gloves were lifted onto the shoulders of supporters in celebration of their new freedom, video footage showed.\\n\\nSome waved the Palestinian flag, while others were visibly relieved as they embraced members of the crowd.\\n\\nDozens of bystanders filmed the moment on their phones.\\n\\nEarlier, the Israeli prison service confirmed that 200 Palestinian prisoners have been released as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nIsraeli prison service confirms 200 Palestinian prisoners released\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Eugenia Yosef and Billy Stockwell\\n\\nA bus transports freed Palestinian prisoners in Ramallah, West Bank on Saturday.\\n\\nThe Israeli prison service confirmed Saturday that 200 Palestinian prisoners have been released from detention facilities as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the prison service said it was “working to release the terrorists according to the political outline that was agreed upon for the return of the hostages, in full cooperation with all security agencies.”\\n\\nPrisoners from Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank were being taken elsewhere in the West Bank, the prison service said.

We eagerly await the moment when we can embrace our Arbel,” the family statement said.\\n\\nA senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ) told CNN that it is holding Yehud. The PIJ source, who is inside Gaza, claimed Yehud was a soldier, saying she “was being held captive by [the PIJ’s military wing] al-Quds Brigades as a trained soldier in the Israeli army’s space program.” There is no evidence that Yehud has had such a role.\\n\\nThe Israeli government had insisted that Yehud is a civilian and should have been freed today, according to the ceasefire-hostages deal. Earlier, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Hamas failed to fulfill its obligation “to return civilians first.”\\n\\nAmid the ongoing dispute, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office has said that civilians in Gaza will not be allowed to move to their homes in northern Gaza as planned.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nHamas frees four Israeli hostages as 200 Palestinian prisoners released: Catch up here\\n\\nFrom CNN staff\\n\\nFour female Israeli hostages were released by Hamas after 15 months of captivity in Gaza. Later Saturday, Israel’s prison service said 200 Palestinian prisoners were released from detention centers. Israel has accused Hamas of failing to fulfil its obligations of the ceasefire-hostages deal after 29-year-old civilian hostage Arbel Yehud was not among those freed Saturday. Amid the dispute, Israel said Gazans will not be able to return north .\\n\\nHere’s what you need to know:\\n\\nHostages released: The four hostages released on Saturday – Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag – had been held in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. The female soldiers - ages 19 to 20 - were among seven female soldiers kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base, where they served as lookouts, observing activity inside Gaza. During their handover at Palestine Square in Gaza City, they were taken on stage by Hamas while dressed in makeshift military uniforms, before being handed over to the Red Cross. They were then transferred to the Israeli military and brought back to Israel, where they have since been reunited with their families.\\n\\nLoved ones’ joy: Family members and partners of the hostages freed Saturday have expressed their joy at being able to see them again after months of uncertainty. “We are very excited now and it’s a big time for us,” Gilboa’s aunt, Dekele Sherabi, told CNN. Gilboa’s uncle Razi Sherabi added: “I’m sure Daniella never lost hope, and we are just waiting for the moment we will hug her and kiss her.” Ariev’s family said their “hearts are filled with immense gratitude and joy” following her return. Writing in a statement released through the Hostages and Missing Families’ Forum they said: “After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety – we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina, hear her voice, and see her smile that once again fills us with light.” Nir Alboro, Albag’s partner told CNN that his heart is “full” now that she has been freed.\\n\\nHamas’ “stage-managed” handover: The hostage handover on Saturday was highly choreographed. A stage was erected in Palestine Square, in Gaza City, where hundreds of masked militants carrying automatic weapons guarded the scene. Hamas appeared to go out of its way to give a sense of its strength during the widely-televised event, displaying a poster featuring images of a number of Israeli current and former leaders with the word “failure” written in English above their heads. Another poster showed the logos of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli Security Agency with the caption, “Zionism Will Not Win.” Many also carried Hamas’ signature green flag. Hamas appeared far more organized than last week, when the hostages were mobbed before being handed over.\\n\\nPalestinians returning north: The Israeli military issued a statement warning people in Gaza not to return north past the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the territory. “We confirm that all the instructions we issued are still in effect, especially the ban on approaching the Netzarim axis until it is announced that it is open,” Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X. Earlier Saturday, an Israeli official told CNN that the Israeli military will not allow Gazan civilians to cross into the north until a female civilian still held in Gaza - Arbel Yehud - is in the hands of Israel or until the process of her release starts. Israel has been pushing for the release of Yehud, 29, who was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Israel says she is a civilian and should have been released Saturday. A senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ) told CNN on Saturday that it holds Yehud, claiming she was a soldier – a claim which there is no evidence for.\\n\\nRelease of prisoners: The Israeli prison service confirmed Saturday that 200 Palestinian prisoners were released from detention facilities as part of the deal. Prisoners from Ofer prison were taken elsewhere in the occupied West Bank, according to prison service. Meanwhile, prisoners from Ktzi’ot prison, a detention facility in the Negev, were taken to the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south, it said. Hamas previously said it expected Israel to release around 200 Palestinian prisoners, including 120 prisoners serving life sentences and 80 others with high sentences.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nIsraeli military issues urgent statement telling Gazans not to return north\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Eugenia Yosef and Caitlin Danaher\\n\\nDisplaced Palestinians arrive with their belongings at the nearest point to the Netzarim Corridor on Friday.\\n\\nThe Israeli military has issued an urgent statement telling citizens in Gaza not to return north past the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the territory.\\n\\n“We confirm that all the instructions we issued are still in effect, especially the ban on approaching the Netzarim axis until it is announced that it is open,” Israel Defense Forces’ Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X.\\n\\n“The instructions will remain in effect until new instructions are issued with the transition to the next stage of the agreement and after Hamas commits to its pledges,” the statement added.\\n\\nEarlier, an Israeli official told CNN that the Israeli military will not allow Gazan civilians to cross into the north until a female civilian still held in Gaza - Arbel Yehud - is in the hands of Israel or until the process of her release starts.\\n\\nSome context: Under the ceasefire and hostage deal, Palestinian civilians should be allowed to return to their homes across Gaza, including in the devastated north.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nIsraeli military helicopter takes former hostages from southern Israel base to hospital\\n\\nFrom CNN's Tamar Michaelis\\n\\nAn Israeli military helicopter transports released hostages in Re'im, Israel on Saturday.\\n\\nAn Israeli military helicopter has departed the Re’im military base in southern Israel with the four freed hostages and their parents, heading for the Beilinson hospital.\\n\\n“The four returning hostages, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy, and Karina Ariev, together with their parents, just boarded an Israeli Air Force helicopter to make their way to the hospital, where they will be reunited with the rest of their families and receive medical treatment,” the Israel Defense Forces said.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n“The heart is full again.” Partner of freed hostage Liri Albag awaits her return\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim and Dana Karni\\n\\nNir Alboro, the partner of Liri Albag who was released from Hamas captivity on Saturday, told CNN that his heart is “full” now that his girlfriend has been freed.\\n\\n“It’s good for the heart,” Alboro told CNN outside Beilinson hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, where he hopes to greet his partner. “The heart is full again.”\\n\\nThe 22-year-old last saw Liri on October 4, 2023, he said.\\n\\nWhen asked what he wanted to say to her, he said: “That I love her.”\\n\\nLiri’s birthday is in two weeks, Alboro said, who added that he hopes he can spend it with her. While he is unsure when he will see her, Alboro told CNN that he is hopeful that Liri was told he is waiting for her.\\n\\nAlbag’s family issued a statement saying “a wave of relief and joy envelops us after 477 long, unbearable days of nerve-wracking waiting.”\\n\\n“We want to wholeheartedly thank everyone who stood by us, supported us, prayed, and sent love during these difficult days. Your support was our beacon of light,” the statement said.\\n\\n“At the same time, our hearts are with the families of Arbel Yehoud, Agam Berger, the Bibas family, and all other hostages still waiting to return home…We are determined to fight until the last hostage returns home.”\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nGaza militant group says it holds hostage Arbel Yehud\\n\\nFrom CNN's Ibrahim Dahman and Jeremy Diamond\\n\\nA senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ) told CNN that it holds the female hostage whose release on Saturday had been demanded by the Israeli government.\\n\\nThe Israeli government has insisted that 29-year-old Arbel Yehud is a civilian and should have been freed today, according to the ceasefire-hostages deal.\\n\\nThe PIJ source, who is inside Gaza, claimed Yehud was a soldier, saying she “was being held captive by [the PIJ’s military wing] al-Quds Brigades as a trained soldier in the Israeli army’s space program.”\\n\\nThere is no evidence that Yehud has had such a role.\\n\\nThe source added that she “will be released under the terms of the agreed-upon prisoner exchange deal. We hold the Israeli government responsible for any obstruction to the terms of the deal.”\\n\\nA second PIJ source outside Gaza also told CNN that Yehud was alive.\\n\\nUnlike the four female Israeli soldiers who were released on Saturday, Yehud was not taken captive at a military base. She was taken hostage from her home in Nir Oz on October 7, 2023 along with other civilians living in that community.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nIsraeli president welcomes hostages home with “bitter tears and a joyful heart”\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Tim Lister\\n\\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog issued a message to the freed female hostages Saturday, saying in a post on X: “Daniella, Liri, Naama, and Karina—you are heroes! Welcome back home!”\\n\\n“We watched you smile, and we wept. An entire nation weeps and rejoices with you at this moment. We are overjoyed to see you smiling and finally reunited with your wonderful families,” he said.\\n\\nHerzog added: “”With bitter tears and a joyful heart” - at this moment, our hearts are with the Bibas, Yehud, and Berger families, and with all the anxious and worried families whose loved ones have not yet returned. We will not rest until we bring back all our sisters and brothers from the hell of captivity in Gaza.”\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also addressed the released hostages, saying: “Together with all the people of Israel, my wife and I are wholeheartedly embracing you. We will continue operating to return all our hostages home - the living and the dead.”\\n\\nDefense Minister Israel Katz welcomed the return of the four soldiers, adding: “We will not relent, we will not give up—we will do everything necessary until all the hostages, both the living and those who are no longer with us, return to Israel.”\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nLebanese army accuses Israel of “procrastination” over withdrawal from the south\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Billy Stockwell and Charbel Mallo\\n\\nAs Saturday’s hostage and prisoner release in Israel unfolded, the Lebanese army accused the Israeli military of “procrastination” over its expected withdrawal from the country’s south as part of a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah.\\n\\n“There has been a delay in several stages due to the procrastination in withdrawal on the part of the Israeli enemy,” the Lebanese army said on X, adding that that this “complicates” the Lebanese army’s deployment. “The army maintains readiness to complete its deployment as soon as the Israeli enemy withdraws,” it said.\\n\\nIsrael was expected to withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon by Sunday’s deadline. But the Israeli government said Friday some of its forces would remain in southern Lebanon , blaming Lebanon for failing to uphold its end of the deal.\\n\\n“The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal is conditional upon the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. “Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by Lebanon, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States.”\\n\\nUnder the November ceasefire agreement, both Israeli and Hezbollah forces agreed to withdraw from southern Lebanon by January 26, the end of a 60-day period stipulated in the deal.\\n\\nHezbollah warned on Thursday that if the Israeli military remained in Lebanon past Sunday, it would be “considered a brazen breach of the agreement.”\\n\\nThe Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon on October 1 – the culmination of a yearlong, low-level war with Hezbollah, which attacked Israeli-held territory on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas.\\n\\nCNN’s Mick Krever and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\nIsrael says Gazans will not be allowed to move north until dispute over civilian hostage resolved\\n\\nFrom CNN's Eugenia Yosef\\n\\nIsrael has demanded that Hamas release Arbel Yehud.\\n\\nThe Israeli Prime Minister’s Office says that civilians in Gaza will not be allowed to move to their homes in northern Gaza as planned due to an ongoing dispute over the release of an Israeli female civilian .\\n\\nIsrael had demanded that Hamas release Arbel Yehud, a 29-year-old who was taken hostage from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, as part of the release, a source familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nThe Israel Defense Forces will not let Palestinians in Gaza cross into the north “until Arbel Yehud is in the hands of Israel or until the process of her release starts,” according to an Israeli official.\\n\\nIn a statement Saturday, the PMO said that “Israel received four kidnapped soldiers from the Hamas terrorist organization. In return, security prisoners will be released according to the agreed-upon framework.”\\n\\nHowever, it added that “In accordance with the agreement, Israel will not allow the movement of Gazans to northern Gaza until the release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehud, who was scheduled to be freed today, is secured.”\\n\\nThe Israeli military’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said that Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor, which divides north and south of Gaza, must remain in a state of readiness and warned civilians to stay clear of the area.\\n\\n“The Chief of the General Staff addressed the IDF’s readiness along the Netzarim Corridor, emphasizing the preparedness and alertness of the troops in the area until decided otherwise. Additionally, the IDF is warning the Gazan public to avoid the area until it is reopened,” the IDF said.\\n\\nThis post has been updated.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n“We just want to hug her”: Family of former hostage Daniella Gilboa reacts to her release\\n\\nFrom CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, Caitlin Danaher, and Ivana Kottasova\\n\\nDaniella Gilboa\\n\\nThe family of former hostage Daniella Gilboa have expressed their joy at her release from Gaza, where she was held hostage since October 7, 2023.\\n\\n“We are very excited now and it’s a big time for us,” Gilboa’s aunt, Dekele Sherabi, told CNN on Saturday.\\n\\n“We just want to hug her, to see her and hug her.

Footage of Albag, clearly filmed under duress, was released by Hamas earlier this month. Her family said the video had “torn (their) hearts to pieces.”\\n\\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Albag as someone who “radiates joy, with a smile and laugh that brightens the day of everyone around her.” According to her family and friends, Albag is a big fan of singing, photography, and cooking. Her dream was to study in Paris and become an interior designer and architect.\\n\\nKarina Ariev turned 20 in captivity. In January 2024, Hamas released a video showing Ariev and Gilboa pleading for their lives.\\n\\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Ariev as someone who “shares the love within her with her family and friends, is sensitive to everything, and always takes care of everyone.” They said she is from Jerusalem and enjoys dancing, singing, writing, cooking, and makeup. The forum said she dreams of becoming a psychologist “and is known for being compassionate and for bringing people together.”\\n\\nDaniella Gilboa is from Petah Tikva, central Israel, and turned 20 in captivity.\\n\\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum described her as a “passionate musician who studies piano and singing, aspiring to pursue a professional career in music. Known for her optimism and kindness.”\\n\\nNaama Levy also turned 20 in captivity. A video showing her kidnapping on October 7 became symbolic of the brutality of the Hamas attack that day. It showed her being dragged by her hair at gunpoint, her hands bound, her ankles cut and her pants soaked in blood.\\n\\nHer family and friends have described her as gentle and quiet, yet full of light, joy, strength, and determination. They said Levy competed in triathlons and played tennis.

UNRWA has more than 13,000 employees stationed in Gaza alone. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it employs nearly 4,000 workers.\\n\\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini warned the move “might sabotage the Gaza ceasefire, failing once again the hopes of people who have gone through unspeakable suffering.”\\n\\n“In only the first three days of the ceasefire, UNRWA brought in food for 1 million people. Our teams have already distributed food to around 300,000 people, including in northern Gaza,” he said in a post on X.\\n\\nIsrael has long sought to dismantle the UN body, arguing that some of its employees are affiliated with Hamas, and that its schools teach hate against Israel.

Ad Feedback Business / Tech French AI chatbot taken offline after wild answers led to online ridicule ========================================================================= By Jack Guy , CNN 2 minute read Published 11:02 AM EST, Mon January 27, 2025 Link Copied! The logo for French AI model Lucie Linagora CNN — A French-language artificial intelligence chatbot backed by the French government has been taken offline after providing nonsensical answers to simple mathematical equations, and even recommending that one user eat cow’s eggs. In a statement Saturday, the Linagora Group, a company that is part of a consortium developing the model, named Lucie, said it remains an “academic research project in its early stages.” Lucie was released “prematurely,” said Linagora, adding that it should have been clearer in informing users of the limitations of the model in its current form. “We were carried away by our own enthusiasm,” the statement reads. Michel-Marie Maudet, general director of Linagora Group, told CNN that the team would now update its model and then test a beta version in private before a public relaunch. After Lucie was launched Thursday, users took to social media to share its erroneous answers, including a response to a user query asking the chatbot to tell them about cow’s eggs. Traders and financial professionals work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the first session of the new year on January 2, 2025, in New York City. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Related article A shocking Chinese AI advancement called DeepSeek is sending US stocks plunging “Cow’s eggs, also known as chicken’s eggs, are edible eggs produced by cows,” Lucie was quoted as replying. “Cow’s eggs are a source of protein and nutrients, and are considered to be a healthy and nutritious food.” Asked to multiply 5 by (3+2), the model gave an answer of 17, instead of 25, and Lucie also said that “the square root of a goat is one,” users reported. Launched with ambitions of challenging the dominance of the English language in AI and providing an alternative to models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Lucie is named after the oldest human ancestor, said Linagora. Its logo is inspired by both Marianne, a national symbol of France, and the US actress Scarlett Johansson, who starred in the film “Lucy,” according to a statement from Linagora published on January 3. “Lucie is covered by a blue, white and red shawl, demonstrating her sovereign French personality,” the statement added. Lucie has been backed by French President Emmanuel Macron as part of his France 2030 investment program, which includes a wide range of projects worth a total of €54 billion ($56.8 billion). And Macron is currently preparing to host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, which will bring world leaders and tech figures to Paris from February 10 to 11.
